# Geomagnetic-daily-amplitude
The software plot daily amplitude of the geomagnetic field with the accent on diurnal variation amplitude 
To use this software you need to change the day date in the request link / url and also the desired station short code.
After you download the data the software will display "download finished" that means all parameters were correct and after that you will plot the data using plotdata.py
The tabledata.py will also create a file table data which is used to plot the daily amplitude.
In image the software were used to plot the daily amplitude of the geomagnetic field with accent on the amplitude of diurnal variation for some significant seismic event dates
This software graphic representation will help researcher to better understand the geographic difference between geomagnetic patterns.
The software can be used with Python after all necessary libraries are installed with Pip.
